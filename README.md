# thinFilmTransmission
This MATLAB code uses the Fresnel equations and matrix method to calculate the transmissivity and phase shift through thin film layers deposited on a substrate.

"thinFilmCalc.m" is legacy code and only supports 2 layers.

"TF_code_093021" is the latest code as of 10/4/21. It allows the user to define multiple thin film structures (upto 6 layers) and also read experimental data values and compare the transmission and phase shifts.
